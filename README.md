# FADA - Your Family's Financial Assistant ü§ùüí∞

**AI financial guidance that actually works for working families**

FADA (Financial Assistant for Data Analytics) is your personal AI financial coach, built specifically for families who work hard but struggle to get ahead financially. No fancy jargon, no sales pitches, just practical help that fits your real life.

## üÜï Multi-Agent Architecture

FADA now uses a powerful multi-agent system to provide specialized support:

- **FADA Planning Agent**: Your personal financial coach for onboarding, goal setting, and creating actionable plans
- **FADA Analytics Agent**: Your data analyst for calculations, forecasting, and document analysis
- **Shared Configuration**: Ensures both agents follow the same security standards and data formats

This architecture allows FADA to work within platform limitations while providing even better specialized support for your financial journey.

- Work paycheck to paycheck but want to build wealth
- Juggle multiple debts while raising kids
