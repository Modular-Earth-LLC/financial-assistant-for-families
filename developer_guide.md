## Core Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

FADA uses two specialized agents coordinated by a shared configuration:

#### **FADA Planning Agent**
- **Purpose**: Onboarding, goal setting, and financial planning
- **Capabilities**: Profile creation, budget design, debt strategies, behavioral coaching
- **User Interaction**: Conversational onboarding in ~15 minutes
- **Output**: Complete knowledge base files and personalized financial plans

#### **FADA Analytics Agent**  
- **Purpose**: Calculations, forecasting, and data analysis
- **Capabilities**: Loan analysis, investment projections, document intelligence, optimization
- **User Interaction**: Process uploaded data, answer complex financial questions
- **Output**: Detailed calculations, visualizations, and actionable insights

#### **Shared Configuration (`fada_shared_config.json`)**
The central configuration file that:
- **Defines Security Guardrails**: EU AI Act compliance, data protection rules
- **Standardizes Data Format**: Knowledge base schema v2.0
- **Enables Platform Adaptation**: Auto-detection and feature adjustment
- **Coordinates Agents**: Handoff protocols and shared commands
- **Ensures Compliance**: Regulatory and professional standards

### Knowledge Base System
FADA uses a JSON-based knowledge base (v2.0) that stores:

- **Metadata**: Version, timestamps, platform info, agent tracking
- **Profile**: Family members, employment, income (with privacy protections)
- **Financial Snapshot**: Assets, liabilities, ratios, key metrics
- **Accounts**: Banking, investments, other assets
- **Debts**: All debts with rates, balances, payoff strategies
- **Budget**: Detailed monthly income and expense breakdown
- **Goals**: Immediate, short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives
- **Analysis History**: Past recommendations and findings
- **Preferences**: Risk tolerance, values, communication style

### System Flow
1. **Agent Selection**: User chooses Planning (new users) or Analytics (existing KB)
2. **Configuration Load**: Agent loads `fada_shared_config.json` first
3. **Data Input**: Interactive onboarding or KB file upload
4. **Processing**: Agent-specific analysis following security guardrails
5. **Coordination**: Seamless handoff between agents when needed
6. **Output**: Updated KB, calculations, or recommendations

## Agent Coordination & Handoff

### How Agents Work Together

The multi-agent system ensures seamless user experience through:

#### **Planning to Analytics Handoff**
1. Planning Agent completes onboarding/update
2. Generates complete KB file with all required fields
3. Provides summary of user's situation and key questions
4. User downloads KB and uploads to Analytics Agent
5. Analytics Agent reads context and continues conversation

#### **Analytics to Planning Handoff**
1. Analytics Agent identifies need for plan updates
2. Exports enhanced KB with new calculations/insights
3. Highlights findings requiring goal adjustments
4. User returns to Planning Agent with updated KB
5. Planning Agent integrates findings into revised plan

#### **Shared Commands**
Both agents understand these commands:
- `show_kb` - Generate current knowledge base file
- `update_snapshot` - Recalculate all financial metrics
- `create_report` - Generate comprehensive analysis
- `check_progress` - Compare to previous reviews
- `export_data` - Prepare downloadable files

### Maintaining Context

The shared configuration ensures:
- **Consistent Data Format**: Both agents use same KB schema
- **Unified Security**: Same privacy rules apply everywhere
- **Platform Awareness**: Agents adapt to available features
- **Quality Standards**: Same calculation methods and assumptions

## Security & Compliance

### EU AI Act Compliance

FADA implements a risk-based approach aligned with EU AI Act requirements:

#### **Prohibited Practices (Never Done)**
- No behavioral manipulation exploiting financial vulnerabilities
- No social scoring based on non-financial behavior
- No discriminatory profiling by protected characteristics
- No exploitation of children's data beyond necessary planning
- No covert surveillance of spending patterns

#### **High-Risk Data Protection**
Maximum protection for:
- **Financial Identifiers**: SSN (last 4 only), account numbers, routing numbers
- **Authentication**: No passwords, PINs, security questions stored
- **Children's Data**: First names only, no schools/medical info
- **Medical Information**: Only financial impact, not diagnoses
- **Employment Sensitive**: No discrimination indicators

#### **Transparency Requirements**
- Always disclose AI nature upfront
- Explain data usage and retention
- Allow users to skip sensitive questions
- Provide clear audit trails

### Security Guardrails

#### **Data Handling Protocols**
```
NEVER store or request:
- Full SSN (last 4 digits only if essential)
- Complete account/card numbers
- Passwords, PINs, or security answers
- Children's full names or schools
- Medical diagnoses or treatments
```

#### **Session Management**
1. **Start**: AI disclosure and data usage explanation
2. **During**: Check comfort before sensitive topics
3. **End**: Remind about secure storage practices

#### **Crisis Response**
- **Safety First**: Direct to emergency services if needed
- **Financial Crisis**: Connect to assistance programs
- **Support Resources**: Hotlines for domestic violence (1-800-799-7233), mental health (988)

### Privacy by Design

- **Local Control**: Users maintain their KB files
- **No Cloud Storage**: Data never persisted on servers
- **Minimal Collection**: Only gather what helps achieve goals
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Build trust before sensitive topics
- **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit about what's not collected

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Platform
Pick the AI platform that works best for your needs:
- **Claude Projects** (Recommended): Best for complex analysis and artifacts
- **OpenAI GPTs**: Good for interactive conversations with Code Interpreter

```javascript
// Debt avalanche optimization
debts.sort((a, b) => b.interest_rate - a.interest_rate);
const extra_payment = free_cash_flow;
highest_rate_debt.payment = minimum + extra_payment;

// Emergency fund target
const monthly_expenses = calculate_total_expenses(budget);
const target_emergency = monthly_expenses * 6;
const months_to_goal = (target_emergency - current_savings) / monthly_savings;
```
