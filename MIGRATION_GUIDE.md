# FADA Migration Guide: Single Agent to Multi-Agent System

## Overview

FADA has evolved from a single large agent to a more efficient multi-agent architecture. This guide helps you transition smoothly while keeping all your financial data and progress intact.

## What's Changed

### Before (v1.0)
- Single agent: `financial_assistant.system.prompt.md` (581 lines, too large for some platforms)
- All capabilities in one agent
- Limited by platform character constraints

### After (v2.0)
- **FADA Planning Agent**: Onboarding, goal setting, budgeting, coaching
- **FADA Analytics Agent**: Calculations, forecasting, document analysis
- **Shared Configuration**: Security standards and data formats both agents use
- Works on all platforms within size limits

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Platform Compatibility**: Both agents fit within OpenAI's 8,000 character limit
2. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent is optimized for its specific role
3. **Better Performance**: Smaller, focused prompts = faster, more accurate responses
4. **Easier Updates**: Modular design allows improvements without breaking changes
5. **Same Security**: All data protection and EU AI Act compliance maintained

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Save Your Current Knowledge Base

If you have an existing FADA profile:
1. Ask your current FADA: "Show my knowledge base"
2. Download/save the JSON file
3. Keep this file - it works with the new agents!

### Step 2: Set Up the New Agents

Follow the platform-specific instructions in the README to create both:
- FADA Planning Agent
- FADA Analytics Agent

Remember to upload `fada_shared_config.json` to both agents.

### Step 3: Import Your Data

**With Planning Agent:**
1. Upload your saved knowledge base JSON
2. Say: "I have my FADA profile from the previous version"
3. The agent will load your data and confirm everything is current

**With Analytics Agent:**
1. Upload the same knowledge base when you need analysis
2. The agent will use your profile for calculations

## Using the Multi-Agent System

### When to Use Planning Agent
- First-time setup
- Updating your financial situation
- Setting or adjusting goals
- Getting actionable advice
- Weekly/monthly check-ins
- Behavioral coaching support

### When to Use Analytics Agent
- Loan calculations
- Investment projections
- Analyzing bills and statements
- Creating financial forecasts
- Comparing debt payoff strategies
- Deep-dive financial analysis

### Example Workflow

1. **Monday Planning Session** (Planning Agent)
   - "Let's review my weekly goals"
   - Get action items and motivation

2. **Wednesday Analysis** (Analytics Agent)
   - "Calculate how much I'll save refinancing my car loan"
   - Get detailed calculations and scenarios

3. **Friday Update** (Planning Agent)
   - "I got a raise! Update my income"
   - Revise budget and goals

## Data Compatibility

Your existing knowledge base works seamlessly with both agents:
- Same JSON structure
- Same data fields
- Same security standards
- Enhanced with new tracking features

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent doesn't recognize my data"
- Ensure you uploaded the JSON file
- Check it's the latest version
- Try re-exporting from the old agent

### "Features seem missing"
- Check you're using the right agent for your task
- Planning = goals/budget/coaching
- Analytics = math/calculations/analysis

### "Getting errors"
- Verify `fada_shared_config.json` is uploaded
- Ensure you're using the latest agent versions
- Check your platform-specific setup

## No Data Loss Guarantee

The multi-agent system preserves:
- ✅ All your financial data
- ✅ Your goals and priorities
- ✅ Historical tracking
- ✅ Security and privacy settings
- ✅ Progress and achievements

## Questions?

The Planning Agent can help explain the new system. Just ask:
- "How do the two agents work together?"
- "What's different in this version?"
- "How do I share data between agents?"

Remember: This upgrade makes FADA more accessible and powerful while keeping everything that made it helpful for working families.
