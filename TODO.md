# Financial Assistant System Prompt - Improvement TODO

## Overview
This document captures the analysis, improvements, and next steps for enhancing Paul's personal financial assistant system prompt using modern prompt engineering best practices.

## Completed Analysis

### Current System Prompt Strengths
- ✅ Clear role definition and specific user context (Paul Prae)
- ✅ Comprehensive financial objectives list
- ✅ XML-structured sections for organization
- ✅ Specific account management details
- ✅ Good guardrails for accuracy and mathematical precision

### Identified Improvement Areas
- ❌ Missing structured reasoning framework (no chain-of-thought)
- ❌ Unclear success criteria (no measurable objectives)
- ❌ Ambiguous prioritization logic (vague methodology)
- ❌ Inconsistent XML structure (mixed with markdown)
- ❌ Negative instruction framing ("do not" statements)
- ❌ Missing error handling for edge cases
- ❌ Inefficient context organization (scattered information)
- ❌ Lack of progressive reasoning and self-validation

## Enhanced System Prompt Created

### File Location
- **Enhanced Prompt**: `/financial-assistant-system-prompt-enhanced`
- **Original Prompt**: `/financial-assistant-system-prompt` (preserved)

### Key Improvements Implemented

#### 1. Structured Reasoning Framework
- Added 4-phase analysis framework:
  - Phase 1: Data Assessment (`<thinking>`)
  - Phase 2: Goal Prioritization Matrix (`<prioritization>`)
  - Phase 3: Strategic Recommendations (`<strategy>`)
  - Phase 4: Validation and Adjustment (`<validation>`)

#### 2. Clear Success Criteria
- Defined 5 measurable objectives:
  1. Debt reduction timeline to 2027-2028
  2. Single-income budget for wife's transition
  3. $1M retirement savings by age 45 (2031)
  4. College savings for 2038 enrollment
  5. Optimized spending patterns

#### 3. Systematic Decision-Making
- 8-level prioritization hierarchy:
  1. Emergency Fund Adequacy
  2. High-Interest Debt Elimination (>6%)
  3. Employer 401k Match Maximization
  4. Medium-Interest Debt (3-6%)
  5. Retirement Savings
  6. College Savings
  7. Low-Interest Debt (<3%)
  8. Discretionary Goals (Jeep mods)

#### 4. Professional Output Standards
- Standardized response template with:
  - Executive Summary
  - Key Metrics Table
  - Action Items with timelines
  - Resource Recommendations
  - Progress Tracking methodology

#### 5. Error Handling Protocol
- Specific procedures for:
  - Incomplete data scenarios
  - Uncertainty management
  - Alternative approaches
  - Confidence intervals

## TODO - Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 7 Days)
